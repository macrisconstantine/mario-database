# mario-database
This project's output is a simple database that holds a small collection of tables with data on various Mario characters consisting of 5 tables:
- The `characters` table stores some basic information and `character_id` for each of of the characters in the database.
- The `character_actions` table links characters by `character_id` to the actions they can perform by `action_id`.
